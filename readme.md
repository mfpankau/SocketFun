Socket *Fun*
(This was supposed to be fun. All i learned was that windows makes everything waaaaay too complicated)

This is just some messing around learning sockets

TEMPLATE files are downloaded, non-TEMPLATE are pretty much same thing but i wrote it, will prob build upon at some point

Want to add windows support but WINSOCK kinda ehhh rn 

so i added some windows, prob sont work but maybe?
